            <p>I am a highly motivated and creative individual who achieved First Class Honours in
            Software Engineering at university and who is currently a Tech Trainee at futureproof.</p>
            <p>In my previous role as a teacher, I demonstrated resourcefulness and creativity when
            planning engaging lessons, as well as organisation and attention to detail when monitoring
            student progress.</p>
            <p>I can't wait to begin working in my first IT-focused role. I'm a self-starter who is capable
            of learning quickly on my own but also someone who knows when to ask for help from the
            rest of the team.</p>
